I'm a third-year PhD student at Columbia University and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory studying sea level change and ice sheet dynamics with Professors [Jacqueline Austermann](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jackya/) and [William J. D'Andrea](https://www.billydandrea.com/). 

I study the interations between the solid Earth, ice sheets and changing sea levels through computational modeling and data analysis. By investigating these Earth system dynamics and feedbacks, I am to better understand how the Earth will respond to anthropogenic climate change.
