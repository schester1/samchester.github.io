I'm a third-year PhD student at Columbia University and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory studying sea level change and ice sheet dynamics with Professors [Jacqueline Austermann](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jackya/) and [William J. D'Andrea](https://www.billydandrea.com/). 

I study the interations between the solid Earth, ice sheets and changing sea levels through computational modeling and data analysis. By investigating these Earth system dynamics and feedbacks, I am to better understand how the Earth will respond to anthropogenic climate change. 


Sea Level and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment during the Holocene
======
The first chapter of my PhD focuses on sea-level change during the Holocene driven by glacial isostatich adjustment (GIA), which is the response of the Earth's solid surface, geoid, and rotational axis to changes in ice and ocean load. Numerous records from around the margins of former Northern Hemisphere ice sheets show a distict sea level history: sea level fell, rose and then fell again during the deglacation. Using a physics based model of GIA, we showed that these records are likely the result of solid Earth dynamics specifically the repsonse of differenet layers in Earth's mantle with different viscosities. We show that these records may be used to constrain the vertical viscosity strucutre of the mantle. This work is in press at [Quaternary Science Review](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108986)


Glacial Isostatic Adjustment and Ice Sheet Feedbacks
======
Not only is sea level sensitive to the waxing and waining of ice sheets, it also plays an important role in the stability of marine based ice. 
I am currently working to couple a sea-level model that accounts for GIA processes with the open source, thermo-mechanical ice sheet model [PISM](https://www.pism.io/). I'll be presenting a poster on my preliminary results at the WAIS 2024 Conference in Florida.
